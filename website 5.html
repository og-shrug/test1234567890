        <p>The ability to identify a symptom or problem from afar is referred to as remote diagnostics.
         In health care, it is feasible for the affected person to be in the home or even overseas and the medical professional or expert could be in a different area.
         This tactic is also employed by the cosmonauts in the International Space Station while using cameras or remote calling for the assistance of the ground staff.
         Furthermore, remote diagnostics is likewise employed by business phones too, particularly those linked with PABX systems; earlier, operators used to switch calls manually, but right now it is accomplished automatically by special techniques.</p>
